# MULTIPLICATION TEST
This README.md is also a journal of the journey of my multiplication test program.

I made this program to test my nieces maths skills by generating random times tables questions.

1. Running it is really simple for now on any terminal run 'python3 test.py'

2. "Well, trying to make this work for all operating systems is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. 
    The square peg is an object I used and well the round hole I encountered first was Windows 11. Apparently that object is not supported by a lot of operating systems (round holes). 
    I had to put on my thinking cap and come up with some crafty workarounds.

3. You know what? I want to use this anywhere and so will you so let me just make it a website right?
   Well I haven't hosted it anywhere so just clone it and try it out.
    Click Play and enjoy.
